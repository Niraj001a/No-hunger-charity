I used HTML, CSS for giving the formet and desiging of my website No Hunger Charity. 
For connnecting it's several button i used Javascript.
For connecting the Database with my web site i used php language to transfer the data entered in frontend to my backend.
Data transfered at the backend is stored in the database table using Mysql language.
Dontation for the Charity is done by using the Razorpay payment section.
All the combination of languages and data work very efficiently.
For using this all i used Xampp server and PHP server as the base.



If someone want to use the project then, The requirement first to be filled are
1.Code writter like VS code
2.Xampp server to use mysql in database and using php my admin
3.PHP server to run it on.
